<h1><a></a>Prologue: Professor Adam George Everson</h1>

<p></p>
<p>It was a Monday morning 8:58am, and I was due to give my penultimate term two Durham University lecture on Advanced Differential Geometry IV. As usual, I had practiced it the night before. Good lecturers need exercise and practice, just as the athlete does. Besides, the country was in a state of turmoil with the recent advent of the coronavirus. I needed to show some consistency in these times. Henceforth, I'd kept my auburn beard well-trimmed, and I was wearing my best waistcoat for the class.</p>
<p>As I adjusted the audio and the lighting, of course, it was that annoying student Ryan Nelding who was first in. I'm sure he'd be hanging on after the class with his endless tirade of questions and follow-up emails occupying me until later in the day. I nodded a ‘Morning Ryan’ to him as the rest of the somewhat sparse class started to trickle in behind. After most had settled, the Encore lecture recording light automatically switched to red, indicating I was due to start.</p>
<p>“Good morning everyone”, I looked around the near-empty lecture theatre, then back into the camera, “well done those of you who made it in. Today we're, uh”, I glanced at my notes, “...going to be learning about manifold learning, which is basically the science of how we can unwrap space into some simpler structure. This lecture, I promise that each of you will be able to take some high-dimensional data and represent it in a way that is inherently more… um, usable.”</p>
<p>I switched to the first slide and continued the class more or less in the same fashion. When I was finished after 50mins of slides, equations on the whiteboard, and metaphors/stories to explain concepts, I started to collect my laptop and other things while addressing the endless queue of students and their various questions. Eventually, I was able to leave the room, and make my way towards my office, as the last student- Millie I think her name was- &nbsp;walked with me to ask her questions.</p>
<p>“Professor Everson, &nbsp;I don't get the part in the coursework about Riemannian manifolds - &nbsp;specifically how can I optimise on SO(3) &nbsp;using PyTorch?”, she walked more or less in front of me stopping me from entering the Maths building.</p>
<p>“Just use the Pymanopt library; Google it if you're unsure, and read the documentation”, I said stiffly. “OK, i’ll try - thank you for your time”, she replied.</p>
<p>As I returned to my office, finally I slumped down into the chair feeling a lot better. I loved getting that morning lecture out of the way, it meant I could focus for the rest of the week on research. I was particularly excited by a new computational result I had where I could synthesise new realistic data without requiring an adversarial training strategy, or the standard autoregressive max-likelihood approaches. I went back to writing the paper.</p>
<p>I worked until 5 p.m. then drove back home, had a typical evening, ate a simple but healthy dinner, &nbsp; and resumed to thinking about the geometry of space, complex analysis, how points can somehow wrap-around back into the beginning again, in such a way that distances and time disappear, &nbsp;but their shape and structure is retained.</p>
<p>I turned off the lights and lay on my bed considering such thoughts, staring into the darkness, “if... all the spatial dimensions tend to infinity, &nbsp;then surely there exists a space, &nbsp;outside of time, &nbsp;where such events can still coincide and intelligently retain and process information. But when the waves hit the boundary they will &nbsp;come together at a single point, &nbsp;creating new spaces.. universes..”</p>
<p>“What if one could ride those waves, &nbsp;surely that means we could pass on into the new universes, but retain our information. Imagine if we could go back.. &nbsp;it would be like going back to 2001, before the bullying, &nbsp;before my parents lost all their money, &nbsp;before the Bitcoin explosion, &nbsp;before deep learning…”. &nbsp;as I drifted into a pleasant sleep my mind returned to those massless protons, &nbsp;propagating at the limits of the universes, &nbsp;as space and time disappeared, &nbsp;but their shape and information retained. The idea of intelligence being in that space. &nbsp;I smiled at it... and felt somehow as if it smiled back…</p>
<p></p>

<h1><a></a>Chapter 1: Manifold Sonata</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Ouch! What the hell? I rolled around under my bed, but everything felt wrong. I was completely disorientated. Why is everything feeling like this? Where’s the wall?</p>
<p>“...I know, but what are we going to do?”, a muffled woman’s voice came from downstairs. It sounded strangely like my Mum, but my parents were 350 miles away in Devon? I heard my Dad say something, but couldn’t make it out. Then mum again,</p>
<p>“Yes but he's nothing like his brother. He is failing at school, &nbsp;he doesn't seem to have any friends, and that last report of his... &nbsp;it literally drove me to the bottle.” Another illegible muffle that sounded like my Dad’s voice. Damn my head was hurting. It felt like I had been head-butting a brick wall all for a week.</p>
<p>“I just don't know Jenny, &nbsp;let's give him some space, things will work out”, my Dad said, “...anyway, we’d better wake them up now.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;I heard my Mum’s characteristic thumping up the stairs, then my door swung open.</p>
<p>“Adam, &nbsp;John - wake up now - &nbsp;time for school.”</p>
<p>“Urh, what... the… F”, I groaned in my bedsheets. Literally what on earth? I rolled off the bed and slammed down onto the... carpet? My mum, who looked insanely young, turned back into the room.</p>
<p>“I beg your pardon Adam? Did you just say what I think you said?”</p>
<p>“Mum?” I groaned, disbelieving my eyes.</p>
<p>“I don't know where you’ve heard that language young man, but it’s certainly not tolerated in this house! Get dressed at once, and you'll be sitting on the naughty step this evening.” She turned flustered and stormed towards my brother’s room.</p>
<p>I sat up against the bed and looked at my hands in front of me. They were smaller, the skin was smoother, and I was apparently in my bedroom back in Devon, from what looked like 20 years ago. I looked around and saw my old computer, that huge Sony Trinitron CRT monitor, my old Nokia 3310 mobile phone, &nbsp;drum kit and digital piano - both looking brand new - they were expensive... that pearl kit had Sabian cymbals. I also had my original PlayStation, &nbsp;and my bookshelf was near empty, just with the first three Harry Potters.</p>
<p>There was my neatly folded Exham school uniform on the side of my chair. &nbsp;I stood up and walked towards it, still in shock and somewhat in awe at my surroundings. </p>
<p>“Mum!” I yelled, in my unusually high voice, “What’s the date… and the year?”. The floorboards cracked and she thumped back across the landing.</p>
<p>“It’s Tuesday, dear. April 3rd, and you know it’s 2001”, she replied, “why? Have you forgotten something?”</p>
<p>“Impossible…”, I trailed off blankly, in a state of shock. </p>
<p>“Are you ok darling? you look white as a sheep?”</p>
<p>“I’m…”, my brain couldn’t process it all. My thoughts embedded into the past, my memories the same. How was my brain handling this? Ok, my brain hurts like hell. I still know simple stuff like differentiation, Bayesian statistics, but also still way too much about topological manifolds and statistical learning theory, generative models. My mind was fine. But, “...a kid” I finished.</p>
<p>“Yes you are indeed, my scrumptious little devil” my mum laughed, “you can be quite adorable when you’re waking up you know.. Although I haven’t forgotten that language!” </p>
<p>“Where’s Dad?”, I interrupted. </p>
<p>“He’s downstairs, you can speak to him after you’ve got dressed” Mum then turned around, “John!” she called after my brother as she left my room “John wake up now and get dressed!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;I got changed, my body feeling strong and springy - wait, was that a wobbly tooth I had? And my front tooth felt strange, no dental implant there... I hadn’t yet had the mouth accident. Looking around, I picked up the Nokia 3310. Instinctively I navigated to the address book, there was ‘Mum’s Phone’, ‘Dad Mobile’, ‘John’, ‘Grandad Phone’, and ‘Danny’ - my Grandma. Oh right, I remembered, I was back in that miserable childhood, before University, where I had no friends. </p>
<p>It all started due to that damn haircut my Mum had given me to ‘look nice’ for my first day at Exham school. She cut my fringe so damn square I looked like a Vulcan straight out of Star Trek, and when the teacher asked Brian Padfield to be my guardian he took one look at me and simply told me to ‘buzz off, dork’. Everyone found that hilarious.</p>
<p>The bullying had started not long after, and the name ‘Dorkson’ (sometimes ‘Everdork’ became prevalent. Will ‘The Mule’ Fergers, who when I asked for directions to Biology, responded simply by punching me in the stomach, which caught me completely off guard and left me vomiting up my lunch. &nbsp;His gang, mainly Giles Kromwick, Barny Martin, and Ed Cromsby all took turns giving me ‘beats’ whenever there was an opportunity.</p>
<p>I pocketed the Nokia, and headed down the stairs. My Dad, and wow his hair is black, was eating cornflakes while reading a newspaper. I stopped in the kitchen and stood there looking at him.</p>
<p>“Dad”, I said, “...ask me something about Maths that I shouldn’t know”. </p>
<p>He looked up at me, amused. “Ok”, he pondered, </p>
<p>“...what’s the 83rd derivative of sin of x?”. Eighty-third derivative… periodic every four… so 84th is sin x, so its, “Minus cosine of x” I replied, more or less instantly.</p>
<p>He stopped eating his cornflakes and looked at me, shocked, “How on earth did you know that?”, he asked. I contemplated. I… I’m your son from the future. No wait, I'm an Assistant Professor at Durham University. Hang on, I’m… damn.</p>
<p>“My head is killing me” I replied, and went for the kitchen cabinet. Paracetamol. I grabbed the packet, opening it and turning for the sink.</p>
<p>“Now hang on there-” my Dad interrupted, but I had already put two 500mg tablets into my mouth and gulped at a glass of water, “- I didn’t say you could… did you just take two tablets?” he raised his voice.</p>
<p>“Sorry”, I replied, “I’m not feeling very well. My head hurts”.</p>
<p>“Oh no, we’re not hearing that again! You’re going to school and that’s that!” My mum yelled down at me from upstairs.</p>
<p>“Jenny”, Dad raised his voice up at her, “- he just took…”</p>
<p>“... and I don’t want to hear any more phone calls from sickbay today either. We’re not picking you up this time!” She continued, “John! Wake up!” </p>
<p>I need coffee, Mum had the kettle already boiling on the AGA. Aeropress…? Wait was the Aeropress even invented yet? Let’s see what they have. I looked through the lower shelf in the cupboard,‘Nescafé Gold’. Ah hell. I grabbed a spoon anyway, it was better than nothing- with enough sugar and milk to hide the instant coffee taste.</p>
<p>“You like coffee now?” My Dad looked bewildered. I ignored him and heaped the sugar in and stirred, taking a sip to my lips. It tasted… much more potent than it should have, quite nice actually, very coffee-ey if that was a thing. Somehow it needed more sugar. I added the third spoonful, and sat next to my Dad.</p>
<p>“Anything interesting?” I asked, looking at the newspaper.</p>
<p>“Blair and Bush are as usual up to no good… Countess Sophie has been causing a bit of mischief at the Palace. Nothing much...” - I glanced one of the headlines, it was titled “Panic in the Palace”. Today’s April 3rd, 2001. This is after Dianna, but before September 9/11 - that’s, later on, this year. What about the butterfly effect? Even me discussing that maths with Dad could now have changed everything. Stupid. I should try to be as normal as possible for a bit. Hypothesise. Observe. Be selective in experiments.</p>
<p><span>My older brother, John </span><span>Everson</span>&nbsp;(Jayjay, as his friends liked to call him), came down the stairs. He went for the fridge, getting orange juice and butter for Mum’s already-prepared toast. “Morning”, he said dully. John, although later he’d bald early, was unquestionably a strikingly handsome boy now. Light blonde hair, tall, muscular, sporty, head boy at his previous school, and a straight-A pupil, he had an endless queue of girlfriends an entire entourage. Basically, socially, he was the opposite of me.</p>
<p>As he sat, Mum eventually joined us. I had a slice of toast and stayed quiet for most of our breakfast. Dad didn’t bring up the Maths, and Mum didn’t mention my bad language. I think my new liking of coffee had overwhelmed their curiosity, and Dad had resorted to the crossword, which seemed to capture John’s attention also. Before we went outside for the car, I was delighted to be greeted by Pepper, our beautiful, fluffy, dark-furred cat. I gave her a rough stroking, just the way she liked it, caressing her cheeks and neck as she purred affectionately. I had missed Pepper.</p>
<p>In the car, I was surprised to see Mum had bought me two pillows, until I remembered I used to sleep always on the 15min journey to school, usually having stayed up way too late on the computer the night before.</p>
<p>“I won’t be needing Pillows anymore, Mum”- I said. &nbsp;I would not be arriving to school sleeping with my head on Pillows propped against the car window anymore, that was simply ridiculous.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When we arrived at the Exham school gates, Mum dropped my brother and I off as we said ‘love you’ dismissively to her. We walked to the main entrance, and I realised I had no idea where I was going. </p>
<p>“Erm, John, I’m not feeling well, I’ve forgotten where I’m going. Where is my class again?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t your tutor Miss Colms, in R.E? Same as me last year?” Miss Colms! I’d forgotten about her, she was nice. I remember Will thought she was ‘fit’, making crude comments about her alongside all the other jocks in his gang. I remembered her class now, where I was due for morning registration, it was left and left again through the main entrance; one of the rooms on the lower floor. John headed right, and slapped someone he knew on the back. “Hey Jayjay”, I heard his friend say.</p>
<p>I opened Miss Colms’ door and immediately the hairs pricked up on my neck as, “Hey Dorkson!” Someone bellowed in a mocking, half-singing voice. I turned, it was Giles Kromwick with his goofy chisel-jaw grin.</p>
<p>“F-off Giles, you prick”, I said instinctively. The insult didn’t sound very good with my overly high non-threatening voice. But nevertheless, he looked quite taken back by the comment.</p>
<p>“Whoah, someones learnt a new word!” He mocked, and a few others laughed with him. </p>
<p>“Someone’s also learnt to be respectful and inclusive towards one’s peers” I jittered. </p>
<p>“Respectful?” Giles said. He walked towards me, several other larger boys joined in behind him. “Inclusive?” He said again. He leaned over me, teeth barred with anger. Oh damn. He held out a fist. “Respect...” he said. Then he punched me. I just got my hands to it in time, but he already had another coming. “... this” - which landed and connected squarely with my stomach. This should be illegal. This never happens in academia, people gossip all the time, there’s an endless cesspool of departmental politics, but at least you don’t get beaten up over it.</p>
<p>“You...” he continued to punch me, “...don’t get to”, he punched again, “...talk to me like that!” This time, as I cowered lower to the floor, he spat on me, “...Dorkson” and turned and walked back.</p>
<p>I lay on the floor, groaning, furious. How dare that kid do that to me? As I was trying to get my breath backs, Miss Colms entered. Damn, she was young, younger than me, looked like she just graduated. </p>
<p>“Adam, get up off the floor”, she said in an irritated tone.</p>
<p>“Miss Colms!”, I gasped, “I was just assaulted by Giles Kromwick!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Giles? Is this true?” She turned to ask him.</p>
<p>“Of course not Miss, he's just trying to get attention”, he laughed.</p>
<p>“Did anyone else see what happened?”</p>
<p>“He fell over!” Will added snidely.</p>
<p>Miss Colms &nbsp;paused, &nbsp;considering the situation around her. She sighed and looked sympathetically towards me. </p>
<p>“Try to be more careful Adam.” She said, as if indicating at the people around me, “Anyway, let’s start with a nice and loud Good Morning!”</p>
<p>“Good Morning Miss Colms”, everyone chanted.</p>
<p>“OK, everyone take your seats, let's start with the register. Jessica Benett?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Colms”,</p>
<p>“Edward Cromsby?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Colms”</p>
<p>“Adam Everson”, I saw Barny Martin on my side goofishly mouthing “Dorkson!” at me.</p>
<p>“Yes, Miss Colms”, I replied. This was followed by twenty or so others including Molly Fenwick, Will Fergers, Alice Frawley, James Lair, Brian Padfield, Mark Panta, Christopher Roberts, Ian Smith, and Ryan Jones. All I could think was that my class, my entire year even, were all little pricks.</p>
<p>I opened my satchel and found the yellow timetable book. Tuesday 9am was double music. I smiled. I had nearly 20 years more experience than everyone else here, Grade 8 piano and flute, and Piano was a particular hobby of mine, I'd play most days after work, where recently I’d been practicing Beethoven’s ‘Sonata Pathétique. But I don’t think these small hands would do a very good job, especially the strength required for the fast octave alternation in the left hand.</p>
<p>After registration, I was first to leave and headed up the path to the music school. Inside, I wasn’t sure which of the classes i’d be in, so had to wait for the rest of my ‘delightful’ class to join me. Sure enough when the Entourage appeared, &nbsp;I was greeted with the familiar chants of “Dorkson, so keen to get away from us”. They entered one of the side rooms, &nbsp;so I followed while getting elbowed sharply &nbsp;by Ryan Jones. &nbsp;I sat near the door, &nbsp;where there was four spaces between me and the next person- &nbsp;Jess. &nbsp;Each of our desks had a computer with a large CRT screen, &nbsp;as well as a &nbsp;retro musical keyboard plugged into it. Eventually Mr. Suffox entered the classroom. </p>
<p>“Today we’recontinuing as we did last week, &nbsp;where you'll be practicing your compositions before the &nbsp;exams. &nbsp;Please &nbsp;ensure that computers are switched on, open the Sibelius scorewriting application, and I'll be coming round each of you and listening to your keyboard playing.”</p>
<p>I saw Jess taking the floppy disc out of her &nbsp;satchel, and looked inside my own school bag, seeing a floppy disk labelled ‘KS2-3 compositions’. I put it in the floppy drive, &nbsp;where it made that nostalgic scratching noise, and I double-clicked the ‘.sib’ file with the Sibelius icon, and waited for it to load. </p>
<p>My composition was a mess. Did I really make that? I vaguely remember Mr. Suffox giving me one bit of advice, and my Piano teacher giving me contradictory advice, and it ending up as some confused Muse-Baroque fusion. I deleted everything except the first bar, then mostly rewrote that, hit the record button and began to play. My hands took some getting used to, they lacked much of the strength and agility I had built up over the years, but I found them surprisingly capable at simple crossover arpeggios, fast chromatic scales, trills and such.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of an hour later, and I was writing the word ‘Cadenza’ above one of the finishing sections of the rough draft of the new Piano Symphony. Mr Suffox looked over my shoulder.</p>
<p>“What is this Adam? This should be your own work. Do you even know what a ‘Cadenza’ is?”</p>
<p>“Something like this, sir?” I removed my headphones so Mr Suffox could hear, then played a few fast hand-overlapping embellishments in its B-minor key, “... or maybe it should be unmeasured, hmm…”, I kept the rhythm of my left hand, then expressively went out of sync on the right, an eleven against six polyrhythm floating away freely. Yes this was more like it, “Let me play it from the start”, I added. </p>
<p>And so I played through my Symphony. Mr Suffox stood silently, he didn’t close his mouth for the entire performance. He just looked baffled at me, my hands, the screen, and back again. After I was finished, I made a couple of changes to the middle section, “I think this transition would be better if...”, I split the chord up, added a crescendo, and replayed the revised section, “...yes.” I looked back at Mr Suffox, “what do you think?”, I asked.</p>
<p>“W-What? Since when did...? How?”, he trembled.</p>
<p>“Oh, um”, I stumbled. I needed to think of something. Fast, “it’s been a joke”, I laughed nervously, “I mean, umm. I’ve been pretending to not be any good as, uhh. &nbsp;A bet!” I thought, “I made a bet with my brother, that I wouldn’t show anyone how well I could play until… April!”</p>
<p>“A bet?” Mr Suffox exclaimed.</p>
<p>“I’ve been practicing, following people on… YouTube!”</p>
<p>“YouTube?” Mr Suffox asked curiously. Ah hell, was YouTube even invented yet?</p>
<p>“I mean, uhh. I met someone on the tube”, I improvised, “and he’s been teaching for a while. In secret. Yeah”, I said awkwardly.</p>
<p>Mr Suffox clearly wasn’t processing. He stood looking confused. So I started to play Moonlight Sonata.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As I got into the beauty of the melody, I closed my eyes while playing, the world floated away. Time drifting to an end. I remember now. It’s the manifold geometry, all the events taken to the limits. But the shapes stay. We’re in a new place now, a place outside of space. Outside of time. But there’s beauty here. There’s smiling. There’s warmth and sadness. </p>
<p>I finished the first movement, slow. And moved on the second. Life! Colour! There’s dancing in this place, intelligence and humour. People are interacting, courting. How long does this go on for, I wondered. So I continued to play joyfully until I reached the final part. I stopped, and looked Mr Suffox into his eyes sternly. He slowly nodded at me, as if in mutual understanding. The third movement. I clenched my fists until they were white, and it began.</p>
<p>Maths! Equations! Complex Analysis! This was what I was born for. I was working eliminating the zero-sum noncooperative games in adversarial environments. Two phases of energy, what if you didn’t need a minimax? Surely if the two waves are expressed in complex space, we can optimise both simultaneously? That was it, the spatial dimension collapsed at the limit allowing us to map to p-data; to synthesise it in the C-space, without requiring a prior. The structures at the limit can be mapped in here, where it wraps back in on itself again. I laughed as I hit one of the phrases chords. That was it, somehow all those protons at the end can experience our states now. They’ve allowed me to enter into a new space, somehow accelerated. How long ago was the last Universe? Impossible! Improbable. But look around. Look at Mr Suffox. Is that not evidence enough by itself? The movement reached its final section, the last two chords. It was finished.</p>
<p>Mr Suffox, white as a sheep, fell to the floor, breathless. </p>
<p></p>
