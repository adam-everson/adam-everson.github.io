    <em>
        Professor Adam George Everson is a 31-year old Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Durham University,
        who mysteriously wakes up 20 years earlier in 2001 as an 11-year-old child again, but with his current
        mind and memories. Unfortunately he had a miserable childhood where he was bullied and performed poorly
        at school. Adam has to learn to be discrete with his superior intellect, but struggles as he attempts to
        stop his family from going into financial ruin. He also has to find a way to improve his school
        situation while balancing his desire to continue his research.
