<h1><a></a>Chapter 2: </h1>

<p><span>I took my notebook from my satchel, and quickly scribbled down the development. Let </span><span style="font-style:italic">f</span><span>&nbsp;map to </span><span style="font-style:italic">C</span>&nbsp;where, we propose an embedding function such that its Hilber space satisfies the Equation - I scribbled frantically. Lemma. Lemma. Proposition 1. Proposition 2. Lemma. Theorem. Corollary. Proof-sketch. I’d have to fill that bit out later. I need to write this down properly in LaTeX.</p>
<p>“That was amazing Adam, I didn’t know you could play so well.” - It was Jess Benett next to me. She had taken her headphones off, and was looking strangely at me. I don’t recall anyone at school had ever called me ‘Adam’ before. Jess was one of those girls you never really took much notice of, small, dark-haired, and ordinary looking . But I remember she later surprised everyone and got straight A’s at A-level, where she was featured in all the school magazines and various award ceremonies, and she ended up going to Cambridge studying Chemistry.</p>
<p>“Thanks Jess”, I replied.</p>
<p>“Why are you chatting to Dorkson?” Molly interjected.</p>
<p>“Shut up Molly, he can actually play really well.”</p>
<p>“What, Dorkson can do something well?” Molly laughed. </p>
<p>“Yes… yes…” Mr Suffox was repeating to himself. He looked like he had gone quite mad.</p>
<p>“Are you OK, Mr Suffox?” Jess asked, looking concerned.</p>
<p>“I-I think I need a moment to myself. Umm. T-Thank you for your playing, Adam… It was quite, marvelous really… marvelous...” He trailed off.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get a drink, sir? A nice cup of tea?” Jess smiled at me.</p>
<p>“Yes. Tea. Ofcourse tea.” Mr Suffox slowly raised himself from the chair, and looked around the class as if he was seeing things in colour for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>“Tea”, he said again. “Excuse me, please”, and he left the room. A few of the class laughed, but most of them were absorbed in their composition. Molly had put her headphones back on. Then, Jess shuffled her way along to me.</p>

<p>“Could you play me something?” She asked. She plugged her headphones into the secondary socket on my keyboard. I thought for a moment, &nbsp;considering what I could play for her. For some reason it was Nocturne in B Flat Minor, Op. 9 No. 1: ‘A Madame Camille Pleyel’ that my hands started playing. &nbsp;My thoughts soon started to drift, and I found myself thinking of the consequences of me playing Chopin to Jess, at a level far beyond the capabilities of any other 11-year old. What might happen now that I was here changing things? Every small little action would have consequences that would propagate, changing events as I knew them.</p>
<p>I decided that I would not try to be the kid I was before, out of fear for events deviating too much. &nbsp;Whatever consequences there were from me playing Chopin to Jess, they were already far beyond my control. </p>
<p>A couple of times Jess said, “that’s really good”, but mostly I was lost in my playing and she was just listening intently until the school bell rang. Everyone in the class then started to shuffle and get their things.</p>
<p>“What’s our next class?” I asked Jess.</p>
<p>“Umm, after break we’ve got Geography, History, lunch, then Double Maths.”</p>
<p>Break. Suddenly a thousand bad memories came flooding back. Memories of spending most of those times, countless hours, in that smelly lower-hall toilet. When that was taken, memories of walking aimlessly around the school in circuits trying to look like I had somewhere to go. Or pretending to be talking to someone on my phone. This had to change. Now. I needed friends.</p>
<p>“Can I hang out with you guys during break?” I asked Jess. She looked at me sympathetically. I realised I was asking her to commit social suicide.</p>
<p>“Well”, she looked awkward, “I think it’s ok. But-”</p>
<p>It was Molly who replied for her, “Dorkson? You hanging out with us? What planet were you born on? Get lost!” </p>
<p>She shoved past me, grabbing Jess’ hand and dragging her away, who looked back at me helplessly.</p>
<p>As the class emptied, Will elbowed me and Giles, who was by his side laughed, “ready for your morning beats ‘ey Dorkson?”</p>
<p>“If you so much as touch me, I will be going straight to the headmaster, who will no doubt inform your parents.” I said sternly. I saw Will's face retract at the mention of his parents, and he grabbed Giles away and out the door by the arm, “Come on, ignore him.” I had clearly struck a nerve there. Useful.</p>
<p>As I began to exit the Music school, I saw Mr Suffox chatting in the corridor animatedly with Mr Adrock, who would later be my most excellent flute and piano teacher and was a long-term friend of mine, one of the only comforts I had in my childhood. Although, if I was correct with my dates, I was currently still being taught by Heather - a dear old lady in the village - but she was an absolutely dreadful flautist. A thought occurred to me, and I turned back towards them. As Mr Suffox saw me walking towards him, he squealed in excitement.</p>
<p>“There his is! That’s the one I was talking about. He’ll be quite the prodigy I'm telling you. Better than Simon was even!”</p>
<p>“Mr Adrock” I said. Then realised I had probably never met him before. He, Peter Adrock, was just a supplementary music teacher at Exham, who came in to give a couple of lessons. I used to go to his house for my lessons, or rather his parents house as he still lived with his mother. He had gone to Oxford University and won the BBC young musician of the year, but then came back to Exeter to live with his Mother, and never seemed to care much for anything other than his Music. He lived for Music, and he breathed it.</p>
<p>“I-”, how would I say this? “I heard you play Flute.” I said. “I would love to study the flute and piano under you.” I said simply.</p>
<p>Peter looked at me curiously.</p>
<p>“Do I know you, young sir? I’ve just heard Mr. Suffox speaking rather highly of your Piano playing. But i’m afraid I’ve just taken on another student and i’m completely full at the moment.”</p>
<p>I felt a pang of disappointment, but I wasn’t prepared to let this go. Mr Adrock, out of principle, always had his flute on him.</p>
<p>“Mr Adrock, please could I borrow your Flute for a second? I would like to play you something.” I indicated to his bag, knowing it would be in there. He looked at me curiously, then took the flute case from his bag.</p>
<p>“Well,” he had said while taking it out of its case and assembling it delicately, “you must be ever so careful with it. This is a rather special flute.”</p>
<p>I had played his flute several times before. It was made entirely out of wonderful 19.5k high-density rose gold, which projected beautifully and carried out low vibratos warmfully. I considered playing here for a moment, but then had a better thought.</p>
<p>“Let's play together in the Music hall, you can accompany me on the Piano.”</p>
<p>I opened the door for them and led them in up onto the stage by the Grand Piano.</p>
<p>“If you please, Mr Adrock”. I indicated for him to sit down at the Piano, as he passed me his flute anxiously. Before he could say anything else, I started to play the introduction for Philippe Gaubert’s ‘Madrigal’. This introduction is usually played by the Piano, before the flute comes in, so in effect I was introducing myself to him.</p>
<p><audio controls class="music"><source src="data/madrigal.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio></p>
<p>After playing the first few notes, I was pleased that I could play with the same characteristic warmth and clarity, greatly thanks to this wonderful flute I was holding. After studying countless hours of Masterclasses, such as those of James Galway, I had long learnt that the key to beautiful flute playing was blowing deeply and directly into the mouthpiece - covering the hole completely - not blowing across it as if it were a bottle. While my embouchure was not yet properly developed, you didn’t need such strength to hit the high notes if you learnt this properly.</p>
<p>After I had introduced myself, and the piece we were playing, I looked at Peter and led him into accompanying me as we began together. At first, Peter’s accompaniment was a little rigid - I think he was expecting me to play in time with him, as if I was used to following advice and practicing to pass my musical exams. But Madrigal was not a piece for playing rigidly. I deliberately floated away from his Piano, as a bird catching flight and soaring into the skies. Peter gasped for a moment, then eased back into his accompaniment, but this time following more freely, two different birds enjoying the skies together. Mr Suffox stood, mouth wide-open again, now he was hearing me play on an instrument that wasn’t an electric keyboard. Now he was seeing that I could feel and breathe Music as Peter did, in a way I don’t think Mr Suffox had ever even learnt himself.</p>
<p>As the piece came to a finish, I held the last note with a long clear effortless vibrato. &nbsp;With Galway’s technique, even without practice, I could keep this last high note for the full ten seconds it deserved, and fade it gently without over exerting myself or letting it run flat. After we all stood quietly in the empty hall for a few more seconds, but it was Peter who broke the silence.</p>
<p>“Yes. I would love for you to be my student. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“Adam Everson, thank you Mr Adrock. That’s wonderful.”</p>
<p>“Adam- Evenson?”, Peter misheard. “Are you related to the flautist Dean Evenson by any chance?”</p>
<p><span>I laughed, “No it’s </span><span style="font-style:italic">Ever-</span>son, sir. And no, we’re not related.”</p>
<p>He laughed also at this, “That was wonderful playing Adam, tell me - where did you learn?”</p>
<p>I smiled back at him, but didn’t want to lie any more. “I had a great teacher, sir. But sadly they’re no longer able to teach me. I feel, however, that you would also be a wonderful teacher for me. It would be my honour to learn flute and piano with you. I’ll tell my parents tonight.”</p>
<p>He gave me his phone number to arrange lessons, and he listened to me play a quick prelude on the Piano to Mr Suffox’s delight and insistence. Mr Suffox insisted I joined the school orchestra as a new first flautist, that was wednesday’s breaktime sorted, just as the bell went signalling the end of morning break. </p>
<p>I walked to where I remember the Geography classroom was, back in the main school building but on the second floor. Mrs Umbra’s class was extraordinarily boring, so I spent all my time working on developing my Proof. By the end of the class, I had two more Theorems down, and had a much more elegant way of expressing the earlier Propositions. History, with Mr. Treyor, was similar. He droned on about the events of World War I, and asked a few spot questions to other members of the class, but ignored me scribbling away at my equations. </p>
<p>When the school bell signalled for the start of our one hour lunch break, a few members of the class audibly yelled “finally!” I gathered up my things and reorganised my pages making me the last one to leave, I had about 7 pages of A4 that i’d need to type up properly in LaTeX tonight. Mr Trayor left before me, and I heard him talking to someone outside in the corridor. That’s when I heard Will Fergers.</p>
<p>“We’re just waiting for our buddy Dorkson sir.”</p>
<p>I froze for an instant. Didn’t he remember my threat to go to the headmaster earlier? Sure enough, Will Fergers, Giles Kenwick and Ed Cromsby walked back into the History class.</p>
<p>“Need I remind you” I said preemptively, “that if you lay so much as a finger on me, I will be going straight to the headmaster and your parents will be hearing of it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, funny that you’d tell on us like that”. Will sneered.</p>
<p>“What’ve you got there anyway?” Will walked towards me, before I could react he had grabbed my notes and was reading them. He gaves some of the pages to Giles and Ed and they stared at it blankly.</p>
<p>“Oh Dorkson. Dorkson Dorkson.” He shook his head, looking at the pages, “first you’ve got imaginary friends, then imaginary girlfriends, and now you resort to imaginary - what is this meant to be anyway, maths?”</p>
<p>“Yes it’s Maths, nothing you would understand yet anyway”</p>
<p>“We’re in the same set, what do you make of it Ed? You’re in the top set.”</p>
<p>It was true. As much as I hated to be reminded, I was indeed placed in the bottom maths set.</p>
