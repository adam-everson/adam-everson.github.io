<h1><a></a>Chapter 2: </h1>

<p></p>
<p>I took my notebook from my satchel, and quickly scribbled down the development. Let f map from R-k to C where, we propose an embedding function such that its Hilber space satisfies the Equation - I scribbled frantically. Lemma. Lemma. Proposition 1. Proposition 2. Lemma. Theorem. Corollary. Proof-sketch. I’d have to fill that bit out later. I need to write this down properly in LaTeX.</p>
<p>“That was amazing Adam, I didn’t know you could play so well.” - It was Jess Benett next to me. She had taken her headphones off, and was looking strangely at me. I don’t recall anyone at school had ever called me ‘Adam’ before. Jess was one of those girls you never really took much notice of, small, dark-haired, and ordinary looking . But I remember she later surprised everyone and got straight A’s at A-level, where she was featured in all the school magazines and various award ceremonies, and she ended up going to Cambridge studying Chemistry.</p>
<p>“Thanks Jess”, I replied.</p>
<p>“Why are you chatting to Dorkson?” Molly interjected.</p>
<p>“Shut up Molly, he can actually play really well.”</p>
<p>“What, Dorkson can do something well?” Molly laughed. </p>
<p>“Yes… yes…” Mr Suffox was repeating to himself. He looked like he had gone quite mad.</p>
<p>“Are you OK, Mr Suffox?” Jess asked, looking concerned.</p>
<p>“I-I think I need a moment to myself. Umm. T-Thank you for your playing, Adam… It was quite, marvelous really… marvelous...” He trailed off.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you get a drink, sir? A nice cup of tea?” Jess smiled at me.</p>
<p>“Yes. Tea. Ofcourse tea.” Mr Suffox slowly raised himself from the chair, and looked around the class as if he was seeing things in colour for the first time in his life.</p>
<p>“Tea”, he said again. “Excuse me, please”, and he left the room. A few of the class laughed, but most of them were absorbed in their composition. Molly had put her headphones back on. Then, Jess shuffled her way along to me.</p>
<p>“Could you play me something?” She asked. She plugged her headphones into the secondary socket on my keyboard. I thought for a moment, </p>
